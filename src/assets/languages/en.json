The idea for our team was to implement a part of the ARM solution developped by CGI U.S. and adapt it to Dalkia's context. The main challenge being the communication with Dalkia's other applications, the interface was a really critical subject, and was monitored hourly, with tools we developped inhouse. From the start of our intervention on the project to the end of my work on it, the interface fiability moved from 70% to 99%",
